# My Ethernaut Attempt

## Overview

The Ethernaut is a capture-the-flag style contest for finding bugs in
Solidity contract.

It was created by OpenZeppelin and is available [here](https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/).

I will use this repository to describe my thought process, hold any code I write and document any useful insights.
